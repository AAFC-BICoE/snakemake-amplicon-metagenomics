# Metagenomic Workflows with Snakemake

## Synopsis
This repository contains metagenomic workflows, created using Snakemake workflow management system. The workflows are command line based - i.e. a number of bioinformatics tools, executed on the command line in a predefined order. Snakemake allows to list all workflow steps in one file - Snakefile, which is then executed as a workflow.
